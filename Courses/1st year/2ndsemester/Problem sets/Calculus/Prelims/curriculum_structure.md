## KEY FORMULAS & THEOREMS REFERENCE

### Limit Laws
1. lim[x→b] c = c (constant)
2. lim[x→b] x = b (identity)
3. lim[x→b] [f(x) ± g(x)] = lim[x→b] f(x) ± lim[x→b] g(x)
4. lim[x→b] [f(x) · g(x)] = lim[x→b] f(x) · lim[x→b] g(x)
5. lim[x→b] [f(x)/g(x)] = lim[x→b] f(x) / lim[x→b] g(x), if lim[x→b] g(x) ≠ 0
6. lim[x→b] [f(x)]^n = [lim[x→b] f(x)]^n
7. lim[x→b] ⁿ√f(x) = ⁿ√[lim[x→b] f(x)]

### Epsilon-Delta Definition
lim[x→b] f(x) = L ⟺ ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0: 0 < |x - b| < δ ⟹ |f(x) - L| < ε

### Infinite Limit Theorems
- lim[x→0⁺] 1/x^r = +∞ (r ∈ ℤ⁺)
- lim[x→0⁻] 1/x^r = -∞ if r odd; +∞ if r even

### Limits at Infinity
- lim[x→±∞] 1/x^r = 0 (r ∈ ℤ⁺)

### Continuity
f is continuous at b ⟺ lim[x→b] f(x) = f(b)

## COMMON STUDENT MISTAKES

### In Limits:
1. Confusing lim[x→∞] with lim[x→a] = ∞
2. Direct substitution when it gives 0/0
3. Not checking one-sided limits for piecewise functions
4. Incorrect sign analysis in infinite limits
5. Forgetting to factor before canceling in rational functions
6. Misapplying limit laws when limits don't exist

### In Continuity:
1. Assuming existence of function value implies continuity
2. Not checking all three conditions
3. Confusing removable vs essential discontinuity
4. Not considering one-sided limits at piecewise boundaries

### In Functions:
1. Domain errors in composition
2. Incorrect inverse function calculation
3. Failing vertical line test interpretation
4. Domain/range confusion
